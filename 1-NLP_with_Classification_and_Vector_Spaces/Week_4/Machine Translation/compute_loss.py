    Inputs: 
        X: a matrix of dimension (m,n) where the columns are the English embeddings.
        Y: a matrix of dimension (m,n) where the columns correspong to the French embeddings.
        R: a matrix of dimension (n,n) - transformation matrix from English to French vector space embeddings.
    Outputs:
        L: a matrix of dimension (m,n) - the value of the loss function for given X, Y and R.
