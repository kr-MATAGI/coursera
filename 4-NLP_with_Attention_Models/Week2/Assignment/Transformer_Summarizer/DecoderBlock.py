# GRADED FUNCTION: DecoderBlock
def DecoderBlock(d_model, d_ff, n_heads,

    """Returns a list of layers that implements a Transformer decoder block.

    The input is an activation tensor.

    Args:
        d_model (int):  depth of embedding.
        d_ff (int): depth of feed-forward layer.
        n_heads (int): number of attention heads.
        dropout (float): dropout rate (how much to drop out).
        mode (str): 'train' or 'eval'.
        ff_activation (function): the non-linearity in feed-forward layer.

    Returns:
        list: list of trax.layers.combinators.Serial that maps an activation tensor to an activation tensor.
